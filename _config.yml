      Local Hack Day brings together the students at your school on December 3rd 2016 for 9 hours of learning, building and sharing.
      This Local Hack Day will be focussed on getting people started with development and hackathons in general.
        We will be having multiple workshops varying from Introduction to Git & Github to learning to build your website and web services in Python
        and also one small CTF event. Be there if you are quite a beginner or enthusiastic about programming and meeting the fellow developer
        community around New Delhi. (Be assured, it will be quite a noob-friendly event!)
